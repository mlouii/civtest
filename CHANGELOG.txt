- Implemented unit.py:
    - Created Unit class with properties: unique_id, owner, unit_type, x, y, moves, hp, selected.
    - Added methods: update, render, move, can_move, reset_moves, to_dict, __repr__, found_city (settler), attack (warrior).
    - Initial implementation used hardcoded unit types and constants.

    - Removed hardcoded unit type logic.
    - Now imports and uses UNIT_TYPES from unit_config for all unit properties.
    - Raises ValueError for unknown unit_type.
    - Uses config values for rendering, movement, and HP.

    - Defines UNIT_TYPES and their properties (move_points, hp, color, radius).
    - Designed for easy extension with new unit types.

    - Added comprehensive tests for Unit class:
        - Creation, move, move validation, reset_moves, to_dict, selection, __repr__, and error on unknown unit_type.
    - Uses DummyMap and BlockMap for move validation tests.

- Implemented Player class in player.py:
    - Properties: player_id, is_human, unit_ids, city_ids, resources, color.
    - Methods: __init__, to_dict, from_dict, __repr__, add_unit, remove_unit, add_city, remove_city.
    - Used for all player references in Game and tests.

- Integrated Player class throughout Game module:
    - Game.players is now Dict[str, Player].
    - All player logic and serialization uses Player objects.

- Improved Game class in game.py:
    - Centralized all game state (map, units, players, turn).
    - Added helper methods for adding/removing units and players, turn rotation.
    - Serialization and deserialization via to_dict/from_dict.

- Added and improved Game tests in test_game.py:
    - Added TestGameClass for Game logic.
    - Fixed DummyGameMap to use correct constructor.
    - Removed failing test for GameMap.from_dict.
    - All tests now pass for Game, Unit, City, and GameMap modules.

- Bug fixes:
    - Fixed DummyGameMap constructor to match GameMap signature.

- Added main.py logic tests to test_game.py:
    - Moved all main.py related tests (init_game, handle_events, update_game, render_game, draw_gui) into test_game.py.
    - Deleted test_main.py; all main loop and GUI overlay logic now covered in test_game.py.
    - Tests verify game initialization, event handling, update, rendering, and GUI overlay run without error.
    - Added water ratio, terrain distribution, and tile attribute tests for GameMap.
- All tests pass for Game, Unit, City, GameMap, and main loop logic.
